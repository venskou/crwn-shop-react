## ‚öí Overview

This is a fully functional e-commerce web application including authentication and payment. The goal of this project is to learn and practice technologies in the React ecosystem.

## üèó Technology Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - a popular user interface JavaScript library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - centralize and manage the state of JavaScript apps
- [React-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) - helps to navigate through React components
- [Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect#motivation-for-memoized-selectors) - a "selector" library for Redux, to avoid recalculations of states by using memoized selectors
- [Redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) - manage to persist redux store in storage
- [React-stripe-checkout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-stripe-checkout) - a React component the wraps Stripe checkout JavaScript for a better React integration
- [Redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) - a library that aims to make application side effects(i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easiter to manage
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) - enable function component to use state and other React features
- [React.lazy](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html) - split React component into different chunks, then lazy load them

### üíà Third Party Services

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - service provider for authentication and data storage
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) - online payment service platform

### Other commands

- `yarn build` - builds our packages (only needed for deployment)
- `yarn prettier` - formats all js, jsx, scss files in `src` folder
- `yarn lint-staged` - start pre-commit operations
- `yarn eject` - if you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
- `yarn test` - launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
